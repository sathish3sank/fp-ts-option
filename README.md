# fp-ts-koans

Clone this repository and learn [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) by fixing a series of tests. 

## Prerequisites 

I'm assuming you have a basic knowledge of functional principles. The goal of these koans is to show you how to apply these with the fp-ts library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. In the cloned repository run `npm install`
3. Run the tests with `npm test` and see all the tests in the `tests/` folder failing
4. Work your way through the tests fixing them and learning as you go
5. If you get stuck or want to check your answer find the corresponding answer in `answers/`

All levels of contribution very welcome, please open a PR today! 

I am writing these koans to learn fp-ts. So I might be completely mis-understanding things or teaching things incorrectly. As such suggestions such as complete re-orderings of the koans and other big changes are very welcome!
